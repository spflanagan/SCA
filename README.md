genome-wide selection components analysis
This repository contains scripts and programs for several different analyses, all using the same dataset. Each analysis has its own README file.

The scripts and programs supplementing the Flanagan & Jones selection components analysis paper in Evolution are detailed in README_SCA. They are released as v1.0 and are archived at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.200439.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.200439).
